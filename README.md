# University of Kansas Dissertation Class in XeLaTeX

This repository contains materials to produce a dissertation meeting
University of Kansas requirements using XeLaTeX.

This builds off an existing [University of Kansas Dissertation Class][KUThesis]
by [Paul E. Johnson][PaulJohnson]. I've introduced the following
changes:

* XeLaTeX for better font and special character support
* Several custom macros to better suit my own needs as a linguist and Slavist
* More modular structure, with a smaller main file
