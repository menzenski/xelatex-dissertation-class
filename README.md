# University of Kansas Dissertation Class

This repository contains materials to produce a dissertation meeting
University of Kansas requirements using XeLaTeX.

This builds off an existing [University of Kansas Dissertation Class][KUThesis]
by [Paul E. Johnson][PaulJohnson]. I've introduced the following
changes:

* XeLaTeX for better font and special character support
* Several custom macros to better suit my own needs as a linguist and Slavist
* More modular structure, with a smaller main file
* Support for the LSA (Linguistics Society of America) bibliography style

## Notice

I feel it necessary to point out that while Paul E. Johnson's
[template][KUThesis] has been officially approved by KU—it's even
listed on the University's
[electronic thesis and dissertations page][thesispage] (see the "LaTeX
Users" heading)—this XeLaTeX version of it **has not**. I plan to seek
official university approval for it in the future, but I haven't
yet. This version is thus provided with no warranty or guarantee of
any kind, particularly with respect to university approval.
